Example training image recognition systems need huge amounts of training data, increasing the complexity of the process. This is where deep learning shine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Automatic Feature Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike machine learning where the data scientist manually provides the features to use in a model, Deep learning on the other hand takes in huge amounts of data and does the feature selection on its own, figuring out which objects are similar or not. This is a huge advantage especially when the data scientist has no domain knowledge of what feature to use.\n",

On the side of the coin, deep learning handles huge amounts of data very well,infact the more the data, the better the accuracy. This is a plus since in today's world we create tonnes of terrabytes of data each day, machine learning algos are just not up to the challenge to handle such enormous amount of data."

    "There are many sizes and shapes of neurons, but all consist of a cell body, dendrites and an axon. The neuron conveys information through electrical and chemical signals. Try to picture electrical wiring in your home. An electrical circuit is made up of numerous wires connected in such a way that when a light switch is turned on, a light bulb will beam. A neuron that is excited will transmit its energy to neurons within its vicinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons transmit their energy, or “talk”, to each other across a tiny gap called a synapse (Fig. 1). A neuron has many arms called dendrites, which act like antennae picking up messages from other nerve cells. These messages are passed to the cell body, which determines if the message should be passed along. Important messages are passed to the end of the axon where sacs containing neurotransmitters open into the synapse. The neurotransmitter molecules cross the synapse and fit into special receptors on the receiving nerve cell, which stimulates that cell to pass on the message.

An artificail neuron consists of three main parts, the input layer, the output layer and the hidden layer. The input layer takes in inputs as the name suggests, it functions as the dendrites of the biological neuron.

This inputs are multiplied by a random number called weights(W1, W2....). In a biological neuron the weights are determined by the size(thickness) of the dendrites.The resulting sum of all the products of the weights and inputs ($ \\sum_{i = 1}^n{w_1x_1} $), this is called the **weighted sum**. The weighted sum is then sent to the center of the artificial neuron through the Weighted Channels. At this point, the weighted sum is added to a random number called a bias, the result of the summation is pass through a function,the result of this function determines whether the neuron will output 1 or a 0(fire or not fire). The neuron may output other numbers but for simplicity think of this concept this way. Later in the text we'll see that the output is actually not just a 1 or 0. **The function** which determines the firing or not firing of the artificial neuron(output of the neuron) is called an Activation function, we'll dive deeper into the activation function($ \\sigma $) later on in the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Perceptrons\n",
    "2. Sigmoid Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons were developed in the 1950's and 1960's by Frank Rosenblatt following the works done by the ealy pioneers before him mainly by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. Earlier I gave you a brief inner working an artificial neuron, that was the sigmoid neuron(the modern artificial neuron). A Perceptron works similarly, the perceptron is an ealier version of the sigmoid neuron we went over.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How a perceptron works\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a sigmoid neuron, the perceptron has a similar structure. It takes in inputs and calculate the **weighted sum** of the inputs and the weights, take a look at the formula below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{i = 1}^n{w_1x_1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "unlike the modern sigmoid neuron, the perceptron does not have an **activation function**, I know we haven't gone over **activation functions** yet, we'll go over them later on but, for now just understand it this way. Things will be clear later on. Instead of an **activation function**, the perceptron use **Threshold** which determines whether the neuron activates or not(outputs 1 or a 0), we output a 1 when the **weighted sum** is greater than the threshold value and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "output = \n",
    "\\begin{Bmatrix}\n",
    "0 \\hspace{0.3cm} if \\sum_{i = 1}^n{w_1x_1} \\le threshold \\\\ 1\\hspace{0.3cm}  if \\sum_{i = 1}^n{w_1x_1} > threshold\n",
    "\\end{Bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "That's basically how a perceptron works, quite intuitive right? If it's still not clear to you, let's take an example of a real world situation of how a perceptron can be used to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take you are for example you are an ice cream vendor at a beach, you want to know when to make 200 packets of ice cream or not. Let's create a perceptron to help you in making this decision. You have observed that two main things affent the amount of ice cream bought, the weather and the day of the week. On sunny days more ice creams are bought since more people come to chill on the beach than on cold days, the number of ice creams sold is also greates on weekends and holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's decide what factor(weather or day of week) has more weight in the decision making. The weather has more weight in the decision making since during winter, people don't go to the beach even if it's a weekend. This shows the weather has more weight on the final decision we make. Let's give the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "weather = 10\\\\\n",
    "day = 5\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for the inputs, 1 is a weekend and 0 is other week days and 1 is a holiday while 0 is not\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "1 = weekend\\\\\n",
    "0 \\hspace{0.1cm}!= weekend\n",
    "1 = holiday\\\\\n",
    "0 \\hspace{0.1cm}!= notholiday\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the threshold value, this could be any random number, the higher the value of the threshold, means the perceptron will be easily be activated and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets set the threshold to 8. Given a weekend and not holiday (inputs = [1, 0]) the output of the perceptron will be 1, take a look at the calculations below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "w_1x_1 + w_2x_2\\\\10 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 10\\\\\n",
    "10 > 8\\\\\n",
    "output = 1\\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a closer look at the workings of a perceptron,its weaknesses are quite easy to spot. It will be hard to train the neuron since a slight chang in the weights can give a completely different output since, perceptrons do not output any values other than 0 or 1, why waste my time creating such a tool. Can't we have a neuron that gives as decimal numbers to show how the probability should be, something like 0.7 or o.8, and basing on those we could get higher accuracy since, we can be able to set better thresholds. Can't we have algorithms that automatically decide what weights to use and tune this weights by making its own observations with no human intelligence, that's the main goal of deep learning right?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the perceptrons developed in the early history of deep learning basically are jsut NAND gates. It turns out that there are artificial neurons that can automatically assign weights to channels and tune these weights, this takes as to the sigmoid neuron we looked at earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Due to advances in deep learning, the idea and definition of what a perceptron is has evolved. We can now define a perceptron as a simple neural network having no hidden layers, a perceptron as only input layer and output layers. If you don't understand what i mnean by layer don't worry we'll soon go offer that, for now just know some people define perceptrons this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sigmoid Neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier its hard and almost impossible to train perceptrons since they only ouput 1s or 0s. To solve the weakness, a new type of artificial neuron was invented called the sigmoid neuron. If you are familiar with mathematics you probablily know what a sigmoid function is. If not well not worry we'll go over it later in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid neuron is very similar to the perceptron neuron, it takes in a set of inputs calculates the **weighted sum** but, the sigmoid function has another parameter called a **bias**, this is just any random number. The **bias** is added to the **weighted sum**. The result of the summation is pass through a function called an **activation function**, in a sigmoid neuron the activation function used is called a **sigmoid function**, hence the name of the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with the sigmoid function, it takes in a value(number) and returns a number between 0 and 1, this makes it easy to train the model. Since tinny adjustments in the weights and biases do not have much influence on the output of the sigmoid function unlike the perceptron.\n",

    "### How A Sigmoid Neuron Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The workings of a sigmoid neuron is quite easy to grasp as I'll demostrate in a second. First the  inputs are multiplied with the weights to calcualte the weighted sum, then a bias is added to the weighted sum. The result of this operations is then passed throught the activaion function, in this case a sigmoid function then we get an output value between 0 and 1. Mathematically think of it will so:\n",
    "\n",
    "## \\begin{equation}\n",
    "z =\\sum_{i = 1}^n{w_ix_i}\\\\\n",
    "output = \\sigma(z)\n",
